It is the best performing asset of the past decade with an annualized return of 230%, beating out stocks and gold by 15x. If you bought $1000 of Bitcoin in July 2016 as of late summer 2021 that investment would be worth $67,867, representing growth of 10,245%.",

As Bitcoin grows as the chosen store of value worldwide it creates a positive feedback loop with its network effect that will likely lead to exponential growth in the near future. Many analysts and experts expect to see a $100,000-$300,000 Bitcoin price by the end of year 2021. ",
